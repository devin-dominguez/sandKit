Vanilla Pd Convenience Abstractions

Check object-list.pd for an overview of the various object's functions.

More in depth info is contained in the patches themselves (for now).

This is most definitely a work in progress.



TODO:

- create seperate documentation files.
- add some other objects.
- put the other stuff that needs to be done in the TODO list.
